# Skills Challenge template

Hi! Thanks for opening this README. I am feeling optimistic, as you must be the sort of person who reads the directions before trying to build something new. We are going to get along great.

This folder is a "Hello, world!" example of a skills challenge scenario.

**index.json** --- This is the core definition of any scenario (challenge or not). Note especially:

- the essential `"type": "challenge@0.7"`
- "imageid": "ubuntu:2004" (this example uses the Ubuntu 20.04 base image, but you should use whatever [base image](https://www.katacoda.community/environments.html) is most appropriate for your challenge)

**SOLUTIONS.md** --- For each task, please provide instructions for the solution. This is NOT shared with the learner, but is for our internal reference, to help test the scenario.


_Please reach out with feedback and questions about this example! And thank you for reading the directions._ ♥️
